# Memory-Hierarchy-Simulator

In this project, you will implement a flexible cache and memory hierarchy simulator and use it to compare the performance, area, and energy of different memory hierarchy configurations, using a subset of the SPEC-2000/2006 benchmark suite. 
 
Simulator Specification 
 
Design a generic cache module that can be used at any level in a memory hierarchy. For example, this cache module can be “instantiated” as an L1 cache, an L2 cache, an L3 cache, and so on. Since it can be used at any level of the memory hierarchy, it will be referred to generically as CACHE throughout this specification.
